- Enhanced deformation resistance for QR.
- Optimized the algorithm for reading large-size dense QR and DataMatrix.
- Optimized the algorithm for 1D barcode deblurring.
- Simplified DPM configuration so that you only need to set DPMCodeReadingMode to enable it.

### FIXED

- Fixed a bug where Safari fails to open the video stream on some iPhones running iOS 12.

## 7.3.0-v4 (7.3.0.4) (04/02/2020)

### NEW

- Added support for Electron and NW.js. Official samples now provided.
- Added an official sample for Nuxt.js.
- Added error checking for unsupported symbologies for the compact edition.

### IMPROVED

- Improved the error messages for the scenario where no camera can be found.

### FIXED

- Fixed the bug in previous versions where an Android device may be miscounted as a Linux device.

## 7.3.0-v2 (7.3.0.2) (02/14/2020)

### IMPROVED

- Improved the process to release a camera in use. This makes it easier to destroy a Barcode Scanner instance in a component (Angular, Vue, React, etc.)

### FIXED

- Fixed the bug on iOS 12 where 1D barcode can't be read by a Barcode Scanner instance when the default "speed" template is used by fixing the localization mode "LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS" and restoring it as the default mode.

## 7.3.0-v1 (7.3.0.1) (01/20/2020)

### FIXED

- Fixed a bug on iOS 12 where 1D barcode can't be read by a Barcode Scanner instance when the default "speed" template is used by changing the default localization mode from "LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS" to "LM_SCAN_DIRECTLY". "LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS" is the mode with the bug.

## 7.3.0 (01/14/2020)

### NEW

- Added a new barcode type Postal codes including USPS Intelligent Mail, Postnet, Planet, Australia Post barcode, RM4SCC.
Added a new localization mode LM_STATISTICS_POSTAL_CODE in the struct PublicRuntimeSettings -> LocalizationModes to recognize Postal codes.
- Implemented the feature of recognizing distorted QR barcode. It can be enabled by turning on the struct PublicRuntimeSettings -> FurtherModes -> DeformationResistingModes.
- Implemented the feature of complementing missing parts of QR Code & DataMatrix barcodes. It can be enabled by turning on the struct PublicRuntimeSettings -> FurtherModes -> BarcodeComplementModes.
- Added a new setting ScaleUpModes to set the scale-up mode for linear barcodes with small module size. It can be enabled by turning on the struct PublicRuntimeSettings -> ScaleUpModes.
- Added a new API Dynamsoft.BarcodeReader.detectEnvironment() that returns information like the OS type, browser type, WASM support, camera support, etc.
- Added an instance property singleFrameMode, which when enabled, allows the user to open a UI to snap a single frame from the camera instead of showing its video stream in the browser for barcode reading.
- Added two new APIs pauseScan() and resumeScan() to better handle the scanning process while showing the video stream.
- Built-in several customizable UI elements and instruction sounds so that users can easily distinguish the following
 - Whether the BarcodeScanner instance is scanning
 - Which region the BarcodeScanner instance is scanning
 - Where the found barcode symbols are

### IMPROVED

- Improved the decoding accuracy for DataMatrix that has a narrow quiet zone.
- Improved the decoding accuracy for 1D barcode that has a small module size.
- Improved the logic for camera selecting so that a better camera may be selected by default in the case of having multiple cameras available.
- Improved the method updateRuntimeSettings so that it accepts three default profiles namely "speed", "coverage" & "balance" thus making it easier to use. Note that "speed" is the default profile for each BarcodeScanner instance and "coverage" for each BarcodeReader instance.

## 7.2.2 (11/27/2019)

### NEW

- Added frame filtering feature so that out-of-focus frames are discarded during the scanning operation.

### IMPROVED

- Updated algorithm to 7.2.2.
- Improved the accuracy for OneD barcode decoding.
- Two WASMs are provided for deployment
 1. Compact WASM: Default. Smaller but only supports OneD, PDF417, QR and DataMatrix codes.
 2. Full WASM: Bigger but has all features.

## 7.1.0 (08/29/2019)

### IMPROVED

- Updated algorithm to 7.1.
- Improved the speed to download, build and initialize the library
- Improved the readability of barcode result text by using UTF-8 encoding
- Improved developerâ€™s guide to be clearer and more precise
- Renamed setScanSettings for updateScanSettings for naming consistence.

## 7.0.0 (08/09/2019)

### NEW

- Added the capability to enable/disable the torch/flashlight of a mobile device (when available, only Chrome on Android).
- Added APIs for finer video control. These APIs are getAllCameras, getCurrentCamera, setCurrentCamera, getResolution, setResolution.

### NEW

- Added compatibility for CSP (Content Security Policy).
- Added samples for Vue, React and Angular.

### IMPROVED

- Optimized workflow for QRCode/DataMatrix/Aztec code recognition. A QRCode/DataMatrix/Aztec barcode zone will be submitted to the deblurring process when its decoding results vary with different binarization arguments.
- Reduced the error rate of 1D barcode recognition, resulting in a higher chance to successfully confirm a 1D barcode result whose confidence is not extremely high.
- Reduced the possibility of conflicts with neighbour barcodes, improving the precision of the zone to be deleted when a barcode is recognized successfully.
- Super large-size (4096x4096 pixels) images can be processed and decoded.
The license key can be written in the script label.

### FIXED

- Enhanced the robustness of the image processing algorithm. This resolved segmentation faults when a 0-size image is passed to our SDK or when there are a few small barcode zones which require spatial transformation.
- Small fixes and tweaks.
