## _bUseFullFeature

Set usage of compact or full featured SDK. If set to `true`, use the fully-featured WASM module. 

*Note: this API may change in the future.*

```javascript
Dynamsoft.BarcodeReader._bUseFullFeature = Boolean
```

### Default Value

`false` for web

### Sample

```javascript
Dynamsoft.BarcodeReader._bUseFullFeature = true;
await Dynamsoft.BarcodeReader.loadWasm();
```

### :+1: Tips and Tricks

* Check out [what features are included](../../user-guide/features-requirements.md#compact-and-full-editions) in compact and full version.
* This property **must** be set before [`loadWasm`](methods/initialize-and-destroy.md#loadwasm).
* We recommend using the compact version in video decoding for its small size and quick initialization.
* This property cannot be set in NodeJS and will always use the fully featured version.
